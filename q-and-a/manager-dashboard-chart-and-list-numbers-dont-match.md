# Manager Dashboard: Chart and List numbers don't match

You may be surprised to see that the numbers in the chart sometimes do not match the number of leads shown in the list on the Manager Dashboard.

This is perfectly normal. Charts capture every user interaction within the selected time frame. A user can interact with the same lead multiple times and in different ways.

The list of leads, on the other hand, includes each lead only once.
