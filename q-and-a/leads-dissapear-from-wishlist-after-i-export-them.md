# Leads disappear from Discover after I export them

When you export leads from **Discover**, they move to **Monitor**. This is by design.

**Discover** shows AI-recommended leads that haven't entered your pipeline yet.\
**Monitor** shows leads your organization is tracking — imported from a file, synced via Zapier, or exported from Discover.

Once you export a lead, it's part of your pipeline, so it moves to Monitor. Discover then fills in with new recommendations.

**In short:** exported leads aren't lost — check Monitor to find them. Keep exporting from Discover to get fresh leads.
