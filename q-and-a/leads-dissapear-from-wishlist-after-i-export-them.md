In `Discover`, your can find leads recommended for you, corresponding to your wishlist criteria and likely not yet propsected by your sales team. `Monitor` view, on the other hand, presents the leads known to your organization, imported from your CRM.

So, it is normal that leads your export from `Discover` view end up imported to your `Monitor` view. Keep exporting to get more fresh leads in your `Discover` tab.
