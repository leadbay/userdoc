# Wishlist vs Scoring Criteria

Wishlist criteria limit your view only to leads that match the criteria. All others are excluded. \

Scoring criteria on the other hand, only score (and rank) leads accoding to how well they fir the criteria. They are more subtle and take into account the importance factor you've set for each criteria.
