# How are scores calculated?

Every lead in Leadbay has a **score from 0 to 99**. Higher means more relevant to you.

### What the score measures

The score reflects how similar a lead is to the leads that have worked for you — your **won deals** and **liked leads**. It's computed using AI embedding models that capture deep patterns beyond simple keyword matching.

### What influences the score

- **Won deals**: the strongest signal. Leads similar to your past wins score highest.
- **Liked leads**: likes tell the model what you find relevant.
- **Qualification answers**: if the [AI Assistant](../product-guides/ai-assistant.md) is configured, positive answers to your questions boost the score.
- **Active lens**: each lens has its own AI model, so the same lead may score differently in different lenses.

### How to improve your scores

- **Like and dislike** leads regularly in Discover — this trains the model
- **Update lead statuses** (won/lost) — this is the best signal
- **Configure qualification questions** — adds another scoring dimension
- **Use focused lenses** — a lens targeting one market segment gives more precise scores than a broad one

The score recalculates periodically as the model learns from your actions.
