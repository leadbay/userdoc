# 🥷 Leadbay for managers

### ⚖️ **Why it matters**

Prospecting is often managed reactively: a last-minute sprint at the end of the quarter, or a massive outreach after weeks of silence.\
The result? Tired teams, neglected leads, and lost opportunities.

With Leadbay, a manager’s role is to bring back **rhythm, visibility, and enjoyment** into prospecting.\
And for that, there are **3 golden rules**.

### 🏆 **The 3 Golden Rules of Prospecting Management**

#### <sup>**1️⃣ Set quarterly goals (# of target accounts, # of actions completed)**</sup>

Prospecting is not a sprint — it’s a marathon.\
Set a clear course for the quarter:

* How many strategic accounts should be opened?
* How many prospecting actions (messages, follow-ups, likes, emails) are expected per rep?

💡 _Leadbay Tip:_\
In the **Manager Dashboard**, track two key indicators:

* Progress on the number of leads liked
* Total prospecting actions completed

The trend charts instantly show you where energy is dropping.

**Goal:** Create consistency, not pressure.



#### <sup>**2️⃣ Open the dashboard at every weekly meeting**</sup>

The Leadbay Dashboard is your **mirror of commercial momentum.**\
Open it systematically at the start of each meeting to:

* Get a visual snapshot of prospecting activity
* Spot weak signals (reps falling behind, inactive accounts, bottlenecks)
* Celebrate visible progress

🧩 _Leadbay Tip:_\
Use the **“Prospecting Actions”** indicator to highlight initiatives.\
The goal isn’t to micromanage — it’s to **celebrate consistency and good habits.**

🎯 **Goal:** Make Leadbay part of the team ritual — just like your CRM or forecast review.



#### <sup>**3️⃣ Make sure there are as many likes as prospecting actions**</sup>

Yes, you read that right.\
If your team stays stuck in _squirrel mode_ (liking lots of leads but never acting), they simply don’t exist on your prospects’ radar.

A healthy ratio?\
➡️ For every lead liked, there should be **at least one prospecting action:** enriched contact, note added, meeting scheduled, etc.

💡 _Leadbay Tip:_\
The **“Activate”** tab helps your team turn likes into actions.\
As a manager, you can monitor this balance directly in your dashboard — and that’s often where performance is made or lost.

**Goal:** Balance _push & pull_ — build proximity before conversion.



### 🧠 **Good to know**

* **Leadbay indicators are built for transparency, not control.**\
  The goal is to empower teams to self-regulate.
* **Alignment beats volume.**\
  A Leadbay manager doesn’t push for “more”, but for **better — more often, and together.**
* **A great Leadbay manager** talks as much about conversations as about actions:\
  “What did you learn from your market this week?” is always better than “How many emails did you send?”
