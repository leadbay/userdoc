# 🏴‍☠️ Leadbay for sales reps

It’s simple: the more you use it, the stronger it gets — and the more time you save.\
But to get results, there are a few key habits to adopt.

***

### ⚡ Why it matters

Prospecting is like going to the gym: you know it’s good for you, but without a clear routine, you don’t go often enough.\
The result? Slow weeks, missed opportunities, and that feeling of always starting from scratch.

Leadbay brings rhythm and enjoyment back to prospecting.\
It helps you **see your market clearly, prioritize your leads, and take action where it counts** — without spreading yourself too thin.

### 🧭 The 9 Leadbay Reflexes

#### 1️⃣ Create your account and import your CRM file

The more context you give Leadbay, the more it can help you.\
Import the most complete file possible (clients, prospects, lost accounts…) — this is the data that will train your AI assistant to understand your territory.

💡 **Leadbay tip:** to help you prepare this file, you can download and complete [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1625r67uMsXkHdGn03IzXcT7oHNRqrXil/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=107964846858017963617\&rtpof=true\&sd=true).

#### 2️⃣ Set up your AI Assistant

Introduce yourself like you would to a new colleague: who you are, what you sell, your ICP, your territory, your typical deals, and your key signals (strong or weak).\
Add your qualification questions so the AI can automatically detect the right signals.

💡 **Leadbay tip:** the clearer you are about what you expect, the more your AI can work for you.

***

#### 3️⃣ Start liking / disliking in **“Discover”**

This is your training phase. Like what fits your target, dislike what doesn’t.\
Each action trains the model to suggest leads that are increasingly relevant to you.

💡 **Leadbay tip:** don’t like 500 leads at once — 10 to 20 per session is ideal to stay sharp.

***

#### 4️⃣ Create your filtered views

Structure your hunting ground:

* one view per vertical
* one view per region
* one view per company size

→ You’ll be able to come back to each easily for your prospecting sessions.

💡 **Leadbay tip:** think of your views as _hunting territories_ — each one should be actionable.

***

#### 5️⃣ Block dedicated prospecting slots

Two or three sessions per week are enough.\
Example: Tuesday and Thursday mornings = “Discover / Like / Enrich”.\
The goal isn’t to do more — it’s to do it regularly.

💡 **Leadbay tip:** add these sessions to your calendar like client meetings. This is your moment to get ahead.

***

#### 6️⃣ Get out of the **squirrel phase** 🐿️

Liking is good — prospecting is better.\
Your goal: as many prospecting actions as liked leads.\
Each like should trigger a concrete follow-up: enriching a key contact, doing research, adding a note, sending a message, or making a call.

💡 **Leadbay tip:** in your dashboard, aim for a 1:1 ratio between likes and actions.

***

#### 7️⃣ Work from the **“Activate”** tab

This is your playground:

* open a lead’s profile
* ask the AI to help you qualify it
* launch a web search
* draft your first message or prep your call

💡 **Leadbay tip:** the chat AI helps you move seamlessly from “discovery” to “contact” with highly contextual insights.

***

#### 8️⃣ Update your statuses and prospecting actions

Every time you send a message, make a call, or enrich a contact — log it.\
Think of it as your activity log: it trains your AI and helps you keep the big picture clear.

💡 **Leadbay tip:** the more you feed the model, the more it becomes your true sparring partner.

***

#### 9️⃣ Share your success stories

A great lead, a perfect fit, a line that worked? Share it with your team (and with us).\
Individual wins fuel the whole machine.

💡 **Leadbay tip:** the Leadbay community loves field stories. We all learn from active hunters.

***

### 💬 In summary

Leadbay doesn’t replace prospecting — it makes it **smarter, more consistent, and more rewarding**.\
Your mission: **create momentum.**\
The rest — leads, signals, conversations — will follow naturally.
