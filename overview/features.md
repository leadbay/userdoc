Leadbay's key promise is getting you new relevant leads at every visit. Go to the **Discover** tab to review them all. You can like/dislike them to signal to the model the kind of leads you want to see more of.&#x20;

The **Monitor** tab contains your already known leads, imported from a file or CRM, or exported from Leadbay. Use it to score your pipeline and prioritize your efforts.
