## Configure a Wishlist

Our AI will look into your past wins and generate search criteria for you to find more [#user-content-lead](../fundamentals/definitions.md#user-content-lead "mention")s likely to buy your product or service. Itâ€™s a starting point that you can refine.

![Wishlist configuration interface](../.gitbook/assets/wishlist.jpg)

The [#user-content-lead](../fundamentals/definitions.md#user-content-lead "mention")s that match become your [#user-content-wishlist](../fundamentals/definitions.md#user-content-wishlist "mention"). Leadbay monitors them closely to generate insight and help you convert them.&#x20;

## Configure Scoring

Contrary to AI blackboxes, Leadbay lets you fully control the scoring. Boost the importance of certain criteria and immediately see how it affects the ranking of your leads.
