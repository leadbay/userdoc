# ðŸ“„ Import a .csv file

You can always add additional .csv files.

From the right navigation menu, navigate to [Data Sources](https://leadbay.app/integrations) and click on "Add new data source". You'll go through all the same options as during the [onboarding](../quick-start.md#upload-csv) phase.
