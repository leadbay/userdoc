* **Create Your Zap**:
  * From [Zapier homepage](https://zapier.com/app/zaps), navigate to **+ Create** and select **New Zap**.
* **Set Up Your Trigger**:
  * Click on **Trigger** and search for your CRM tool (e.g., Hubspot, Salesforce) to set it as the data source. Ensure that the connection is properly configured.
  * Pick an event to trigger data export towards Leadbay. ideally make sure whenever there is a new company, or a change of status (e.g. `won`, `lost`) that your CRM lets Leadbay know.

  * Click on **Action** to set up the Leadbay connection as the next step in your workflow.
  * To acctivate the connection, you must click on the `Sign in` button next to your Leadbay action and then. Zapier will prompt you to authorize it on Leadbay. Choose `Allow`. This is only necessary the first time you use Leadbay in your Zaps.
