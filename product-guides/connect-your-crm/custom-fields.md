# ðŸŽ¨ Custom fields

Custom fields are a way to add additional information about your leads that is not present in the default fields. This can be useful for adding information that is specific to your business or industry.

To add a custom field:

1. Navigate to the [Data page](https://leadbay.app/integrations) and click on the "Add new custom field" button.

2. Fill in the name of the custom field.

3. Now you can import data. Follow the same steps as you would for importing a .csv file, but on the "Mapping fields" step, you will see your custom field listed.

Note that you cannot yet edit the mapping of a data source that has already been imported.
