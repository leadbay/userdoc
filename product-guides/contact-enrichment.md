**Results:**

* Phone numbers: \~65% coverage
* Emails: \~80% coverage

Tested across various industries and company types.

**How does Leadbay suggest contacts?**

Leadbay automatically suggests people to enrich based on your **target persona**.

#### Example:

If your target is **Head of Sales**, Leadbay will find and suggest:

* People **close to this role** (e.g., Sales Directors, Commercial Managers)
* Within companies you’re tracking
* And across public data and internal data

These suggestions appear under **“To be enriched contacts”**.\
You can enrich them with one click.

Once enriched, they move up to **“Enriched / added contacts”** with their:

* Email (if available)
* Phone (if available)
* LinkedIn profile

#### Billing

* Leadbay uses **Stripe** for secure billing,
* Click **"Manage my billing"** to update your payment method or subscription.

#### Enrichment Credits

* You have a monthly pack of enrichment credits.
  * By default : **1,000 credits/month**
* The progress bar shows how many credits you've used (e.g., **45/70**).

👉 **You’re only charged credits when enrichment is successful.**

👉 **You're charged only for credit used, in that case 45 credits \* 0,06€ = 2,70€.**&#x20;

* You can increase or decrease your monthly credit pack using the **+ / –** buttons.
* You can also **toggle enrichment On/Off** at any time using the switch.

### 6. Privacy

Your enriched data is **only visible to your organization**.\
It will **never** be shared with or reused by other Leadbay customers.\
Think of it like your private CRM—just like Salesforce.
