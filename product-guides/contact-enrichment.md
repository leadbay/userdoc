# Contact Enrichment

### 1. Where do the phone numbers and emails come from?

Leadbay partners with **FullEnrich**, the most reliable provider we've tested for contact data.\
FullEnrich uses a **waterfall strategy** — searching over 15 databases in order. If one source doesn't have the data, the next is queried automatically.

**Results:**

* Phone numbers: ~65% coverage
* Emails: ~80% coverage

Tested across various industries and company types.

### 2. Enrich a suggested contact

1. Open a lead profile and go to the **Contacts** tab,

2. Click **Enrich** on any suggested contact,

3. Wait a few seconds (max 2 minutes),
4. You're only charged if the data is found.

**How does Leadbay suggest contacts?**

Leadbay automatically suggests people to enrich based on your **target persona**.

If your target is **Head of Sales**, Leadbay will find and suggest:

* People **close to this role** (e.g., Sales Directors, Commercial Managers)
* Within companies you're tracking

These suggestions appear under **"To be enriched contacts"**.\
Once enriched, they move to **"Enriched / added contacts"** with their email, phone, and LinkedIn profile.

### 3. Enrich a contact Leadbay didn't suggest

Two options:

1. **Manual entry**: enter name and surname via **Add contact**, then click **Enrich**
2. **LinkedIn**: paste the LinkedIn URL in **Add contact**, then click **Enrich**

### 4. Bulk Enrichment

You can enrich contacts for multiple leads at once:

1. Select leads using checkboxes in any tab (Discover, Monitor, or Activate)
2. Click **Enrichment** in the toolbar
3. Choose the **job titles** you want to target
4. Launch the bulk enrichment

You'll receive a **notification** (bell icon, top-right) when enrichments complete.

### 5. How much does it cost?

* **Email**: 1 token (€0.06 per match)
* **Phone number**: 10 tokens (€0.60 per match)

**Examples:**

* Spend €30 → up to 500 matched emails **or** 50 phones
* Spend €3,000 → up to 50,000 matched emails **or** 5,000 phones

### 6. Subscription & Enrichment Tokens

Manage billing and enrichment tokens from the **Subscription** tab in the side menu.

#### Billing

* Leadbay uses **Stripe** for secure billing
* Click **"Manage my subscription"** to update your payment method or subscription

#### Enrichment Tokens

* You have a monthly pack of enrichment tokens (default varies by plan)
* The progress bar shows how many tokens you've used
* You're **only charged tokens when enrichment is successful**
* Adjust your monthly token pack using the **+ / –** buttons
* Toggle enrichment **On/Off** at any time using the switch

### 7. Privacy

Your enriched data is **only visible to your organization**.\
It will **never** be shared with or reused by other Leadbay customers.
