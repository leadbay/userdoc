# Manager Dashboard

The Dashboard gives managers visibility into their team's prospecting activity, and lets individual reps track their own performance.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Open the side menu (hamburger icon, top-left) and click **Dashboard**.

---

## Filters

At the top of the dashboard, two controls:

- **Team member selector**: pick one, several, or all team members
- **Time range**: Last 3 months, Last month, Last week, or custom range

---

## Metrics Table

A table comparing team members across four key indicators:

| Metric | What it counts |
|--------|---------------|
| **Website clicked** | Number of lead websites visited |
| **Liked leads** | Leads liked (thumbs up) |
| **Exported leads** | Leads exported to CSV or CRM |
| **Prospecting actions** | Actions logged (still chasing, meeting planned, etc.) |

Each row is one team member. Use this to spot who's active and who might need support.

---

## Activity Evolution Chart

Below the table, a chart shows the trend over time for each metric. Toggle metrics on/off using the checkboxes to focus on what matters.

This chart captures **every interaction**, so numbers may be higher than the lead list (a user can interact with the same lead multiple times).

{% hint style="info" %}
Open the Dashboard at every weekly team meeting. It takes 10 seconds to spot who's building momentum and who's falling behind.
