# ðŸ”Œ Connect your CRM with Zapier (beta)

#### What is Zapier?

Zapier acts as a bridge that connects thousands of apps and services, automating workflows without the need for coding. It enables the creation of automated actions, known as Zaps, which trigger when specific events occur in one app, leading to an action in another app, all without human intervention.

Leadbay relies on Zapier to connect to your CRM.
