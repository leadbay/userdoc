# Onboarding

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to go through Onboarding only the first time the organization joins Leadbay. If you are invited to an existing organization, you can start using Leadbay immediately.

Sign up at [https://leadbay.ai/](https://leadbay.ai/) — no demo required, start for free.
{% endhint %}

When you first sign up, Leadbay walks you through an **8-step guided onboarding** that introduces the key features hands-on.

## Step 1 — Create your account

We'll ask for your name, email, and a password. You'll then verify your email by clicking a link we send you.

## Step 2 — Tell us about your past wins

To personalize recommendations, our AI needs a glimpse into your past leads.

### Upload a CSV

Provide a CSV file with past CRM data. It doesn't have to be perfect or complete — the more the better, but we'll work with what you give us.

### Map fields

Every CRM calls things by different names. Leadbay auto-detects your columns — verify or correct the mapping.

The most important field is **Status** — it tells our AI which leads were won or lost. This is how the model learns what kind of leads work for you.

We'll also ask you to confirm how you name your statuses.

Once done, you'll see your first selection of AI-recommended leads.

Don't have a CSV? You can still start — Leadbay will build recommendations from your description and qualification questions. You can always import data later from [Data Sources](data-sources.md).
