# 📱 Enrichment

### 1. Where do the phone numbers and emails come from?

Leadbay partners with **FullEnrich**, the most reliable provider we've tested for contact data.\
FullEnrich uses a **waterfall strategy**—searching over 15 databases in order. If one source doesn’t have the data, the next is queried automatically.

**Results:**

* Phone numbers: \~65% coverage
* Emails: \~80% coverage

Tested across various industries and company types.

### 2. How to enrich a contact - suggested by Leadbay ?

1. Go to the suggested enrichment list,
2. Click **Enrich** on any contact,
3. Wait a few seconds (max 2 minutes),
4. You’re only charged if the data is found.



**How does Leadbay suggest contacts?**

Leadbay automatically suggests people to enrich based on your **target persona**.

#### Example:

If your target is **Head of Sales**, Leadbay will find and suggest:

* People **close to this role** (e.g., Sales Directors, Commercial Managers)
* Within companies you’re tracking
* And across public data and internal data

These suggestions appear under **“To be enriched contacts”**.\
You can enrich them with one click.

Once enriched, they move up to **“Enriched / added contacts”** with their:

* Email (if available)
* Phone (if available)
* LinkedIn profile

You can manage your Leadbay billing and enrichment credits directly from the **Subscription** tab.

#### Billing

* Click **"Manage my billing"** to update your payment method or subscription.

#### Enrichment Credits

* You have a monthly pack of enrichment credits.
  * Example: **70 credits/month**
* The progress bar shows how many credits you've used (e.g., **45/70**).

👉 **You’re only charged credits when enrichment is successful.**

👉 **You're chared only for credit used, in that case 45 credits**

* You can increase or decrease your monthly credit pack using the **+ / –** buttons.
* You can also **toggle enrichment On/Off** at any time using the switch.

### 7. Privacy

Your enriched data is **only visible to your organization**.\
It will **never** be shared with or reused by other Leadbay customers.\
Think of it like your private CRM—just like Salesforce.
