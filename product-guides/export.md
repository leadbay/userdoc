# Export

Export leads from any tab to use them outside Leadbay — in your CRM, email tool, or spreadsheet.

## How to Export

1. Select leads using the checkboxes in any tab (Discover, Monitor, or Activate)
2. Click **Export** in the toolbar
3. Choose your export format

### CSV Export

Exports two files:

- **Companies**: company name, description, location, sector, size, website, SIREN, status
- **Enriched contacts**: last name, first name, email, phone, job title, LinkedIn profile

Only contacts that have been enriched are included in the contacts file.

### Map Export

Select leads and click **Map** to visualize them geographically. You can:

- Navigate between lead locations
- Share the map link with colleagues
- Open the map on your phone for field visits

## What Happens After Export

- Leads exported from **Discover** move to **Monitor**. This is expected — they've entered your pipeline.
- Leads in **Monitor** and **Activate** stay where they are after export.
- Exported data can also be pushed automatically to your CRM via [Zapier](data-sources.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
If leads seem to "disappear" from Discover after export, check Monitor — that's where they went.
